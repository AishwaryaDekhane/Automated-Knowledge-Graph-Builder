Contents,"Altera Corporationis a manufacturer ofprogrammable logic devices(PLDs) headquartered inSan Jose, California. It was founded in 1983 and acquired byIntelin 2015 before becoming independent once again in 2024 as a company focused on development ofField-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)technology andsystem on a chipFPGAs."
Products[edit],"The company was founded in 1983 by semiconductor veterans Rodney Smith, Robert Hartmann, James Sansbury, and Paul Newhagen with $500,000 inseed money. The name of the company was a play on ""alterable"", the type of chips the company created. In 1988, Altera became apublic companyvia aninitial public offering(IPO).[2]"
"Intel Partnership, Acquisition and Ownership[edit]","On December 28, 2015, the company was acquired byInteland became a newly formed business unit called Programmable Solutions Group (PSG).[3]In October 2023, Intel announced it would be spinning off PSG into a separate company at the start of 2024, while maintaining majority ownership and intending to seek an IPO within three years.[4][5]In February 2024, Intel announced that the newly independent company would reestablish the Altera name and branding.[6]"
Restatement of financial results[edit],"The main product lines from Altera are theAgilexFPGA product lines, and their predecessors: the high-endStratixseries, mid-range Arria series,[7]and lower-cost Cyclone series; as well as the MAX series non-volatile FPGAs."
See also[edit],"Altera and its partners offer an array ofsemiconductor intellectual property coresthat serve as building blocks that design engineers can drop into their system designs to perform specific functions. IP cores eliminate some of the time-consuming tasks of creating every block in a design from scratch. In 2000, Altera acquired Designpro and Northwest Logic, providers of IP cores, in order to expand its design capabilities and move towards delivery of complete system-on-chip solutions.[8][9]"
References[edit],"Beginning in December 2012, the company announced the shipment of its firstsystem on a chipFPGA devices using a fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) 28nm chip manufacturing process. These are the Cyclone V SoC devices, which have a dual-coreARM architectureCortex-A9 processor system with FPGA logic on a single chip.[10]These devices integrated FPGAs with full hard processor systems based aroundARM architectureonto a single device.[11][12]As of 2024, the majority of Altera's FPGA devices are available as an SoC variant with an ARM hard processor system integrated with the FPGA as a single system on a chip."
